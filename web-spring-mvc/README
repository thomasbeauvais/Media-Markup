Feature Requests:
o   Does it make sense to have 'child' comments be able to select a different region than the parent?
    For instance, someone makes a new selection and comment does it make sense for someone to comment saying, "No,
    check out this selection!"

o   Drop markers instead of regions

o   Higher contrast between the waveform and the background

o   Ability to zoom in

Known Issues:
o   The slideUp() and slideDown() functions cause a jitter in the layout of the page.  This is probably do to
    incorrect styling and absolute positioning.
