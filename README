Your mom!

Todo List
o   Switch from Log4J to Simple Logging Facade

Feature Requests:
o   Does it make sense to have 'child' comments be able to select a different region than the parent?
    For instance, someone makes a new selection and comment does it make sense for someone to comment saying, "No,
    check out this selection!"

o   Drop markers instead of regions

o   Higher contrast between the waveform and the background

o   Ability to zoom in

o   It would be better to have good buffering.  Get a hold of the peoples at SoundManager.

Known Issues:
o   The slideUp() and slideDown() functions cause a jitter in the layout of the page.  This is probably do to
    incorrect styling and absolute positioning.

Technologies:

Spring: MVC, JPA, Data, Data Rest, Core (Dependnecy Injections)
Tomcat: the preferred servlet container
H2: in-memory and file based SQL database (see Spring (in spring-data.xml) configuration)
JPA: Java Persistence API as the ORM
Maven: Build and deploy the WAR and Java projects (might move to Graddle)
Javascript: jQuery and Bootstrap

NOTES:

Use your favorite web application server to deploy such as Apache Tomcat

To view a list of summaries (files uploaded) go to: http://localhost:8080/summary

{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/summary{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  },
  "_embedded" : {
    "summaries" : [ {
      "time" : 208.80104,
      "dateUploaded" : 1404322902899,
      "name" : null,
      "description" : null,
      "size" : 0,
      "audioFileUid" : "9bad582a-2a7a-4617-8ebe-e4cf6ed6ae86",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/summary/b1aa10ab-043b-430a-b187-c394ebf38dee"
        },
        "annotations" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/summary/b1aa10ab-043b-430a-b187-c394ebf38dee/annotations"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 1,
    "totalPages" : 1,
    "number" : 0
  }
}

Take an ID from the list in the "self" selection and pass it to the controllers that require an index.

For example, to update visual data visit:

http://localhost:8080/visual?index=b1aa10ab-043b-430a-b187-c394ebf38dee&width=1000

To load the working waveform visualization visit:

http://localhost:8080/view/waveform?index=b1aa10ab-043b-430a-b187-c394ebf38dee

Notice that /view is a "passthru" controller meaning that it bypasses the Spring MVC Front Controller
allow it to simple load a JSP file with the Spring Beans loaded.
